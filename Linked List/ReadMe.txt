The main file holds the Linked List Object and the functions to manage it. There are functions to initilize and delete along with functions to sum up the list, count the number of nodes, copy a list, head insert, reverse the list, remove a node and a couple others. 
This file did not use OOP but I could easily convert it into OOP code.
