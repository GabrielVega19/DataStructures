The stack files hold the code for the stack object to allow for opaque object design. It has functions to initilize, destroy, push onto stack, pop from stack, and a couple more.
The main file simply creates a stack object and then pushed 10 ints onto the stack and then pops them off printing the top of the stack as it goes.
